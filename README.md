# Library-System

### Java/SQL - Library System

### Description :
Through using the knowledge I gained of Java through my first year at university I decided to create a Library system. The library system was created using a UML Class diagram to identify what OOP techniques the project will include as well as an SQL connector to store all the data of the users and the books making this a software a CRUD Library System. Functions found here are found in a standard library system including a login screen and a place to return and borrow books with a simple GUI as I didn't have the time due to going on holiday a couple of days after the core of the system was done.
