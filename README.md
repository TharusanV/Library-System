### Java/SQL - Library System
**Description:** During my first year at Brunel we learn't Java for the programming module with the final exam revolving creating methods for a bunch of questions relating to Connect 4 and the group project module where myself and seven others had to create an Airline System. Therefore, as for whatever reason at the time I didn't create any other proper project a part from the Airline system which in all fairness works sort off but the level of coding throughout the different components wasn't to a high standard in my opinion as you would imagine with a group of people with some caring more than others due to the first year not counting. That being said during the holidays created this just to display my knowledge of Java whilst also learning how to connect MySQL to Java.
